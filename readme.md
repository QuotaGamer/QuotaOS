# QuotaOS - A Purely Batch-made "OS".
QuotaOS, originally named BatchOS, is an "OS" purely made out of the interpreted programming language- Batch! 
The OS in quotes because QuotaOS is NOT a real OS. It's more of an emulation of a 1980s style OS.

## History
QuotaOS was created by QuotaGamer on July 10, 2021. Originally just a small side project but school had
started back up for QuotaGamer, and he was just losing motivation to work on QuotaOS anymore, however
still occasionally updated QuotaOS. QuotaGamer went from July 12, 2021 to December 3, 2021 with
absolutely 0 updates. Then from December 4th to December 8th there were consistent updates. Then, there
were no more updates until March of 2022, where on March 19, 2022, QuotaOS Alpha 13 was released. Well,
to put it simply, there were 188 days with 0 QuotaOS updates, and was never actually committed until it
was rediscovered on January 2, 2024, also the same date that MunaLoona was added as a collaborator, and
would go on to overhaul the login system, and in the future, the whole OS.
