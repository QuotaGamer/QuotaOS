# QuotaOS - A Purely Batch "OS".
QuotaOS, originally named BatchOS, is an "OS" purely made out of the interpreted programming language... Batch! 
The OS in quotes because QuotaOS is NOT a real OS. It's more of an emulation of a 1980s OS.

## History
QuotaOS was created by QuotaGamer on July 10, 2021. Originally just a small side project but school had started back up for QuotaGamer, and he was losing motivation to work on QuotaOS anymore, however still occasionally updated QuotaOS. After about 5 months with no updates, QuotaGamer decided to finally update QuotaOS. Mainly just bugfixing, but also adding an "Auto Updates" feature that never ended up working. Then, on March 19, 2022, QuotaOS Alpha 13 was released. The update A13 would be the only update that wouldn't get updated until well over a year and a half later, although A14 was created 188 days after, it was not commited until January 2nd 2024. Also the same date that MoonaLoona (munaloona) was added as a collaborator; and would go on to overhaul the login system, and in the future, the whole "OS".
